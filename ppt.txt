Introduction​

Qubits are the basis of quantum computing technology. A qubit is a binary unit of quantum information and  can be represented by an atom's ground |0⟩ and |1⟩ excited states. The dynamics of the atom's wavefunction is described by the time-dependent Schr ̈odinger equation.​



 The collapse of the wave function |Ψ⟩  to the ground state |0⟩  is known as a quantum jump and the evolution of wavefunction over time| (t)i as a quantum trajectory.
